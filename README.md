## About

* This an updated version of the Basic-Portfolio repository. It is responsive to different sized viewports, as media queries have been added to the CSS. This portfolio is a collection of 3 linked web pages (About, Portfolio, and Contact) and related files. They were created using HTML and CSS. The `About` page provides a profile image and text. The `Portfolio` page has 5 clickable images (which are currently placeholder links.) The `Contact` page contains elements where a person's name, email, and message may be entered. The text that is enetered into the fields do not currently go anywhere, as this page is solely HTML and CSS. This is part of the second Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp homework assignment.
