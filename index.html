                Hello, my name is Kyra Davis. I am a native to Nashville, and I am on the journey to becoming a web
                developer. I attended Vanderbilt University and graduated with a bachelor's in Psychology
                (Research Concentration). After graduating, I spent two years in Gunma, Japan teaching English to
                junior high
                school students.
            </p>

            <p>
                After returning to the United States, I joined a startup tech company. The company's
                main focus was perfecting their app and website for patients and caregivers so that they could easily
                manage several medications in one place. As a Care
                Advisor, I assisted patients with their experience with our products and services. By working closely
                with the developer team, my interest in web app development began to spark.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am currently learning coding and full stack web development in the Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp. It is
                a
                challenge, but it is also very exciting. There is always so much more to learn and add to my coding
                toolbox!
            </p>
